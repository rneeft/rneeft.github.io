My name is Rick Neeft, a software programmer in The Netherlands. I work for VECOZO, but **this blog, its content and opinions are my own and do not represent my employer's view in any way**. I finished my master's degree at the Open University on a testing subject. My coding journey started when I was 8 with my MSX2 computer and programming in BASIC. I have over 15 years of application development using Microsoft (.NET) technologies. 

I created the unofficial but most impressive and user-friendly **TOP2000** app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chroomsoft.top2000) and [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/top-2000/9wzdncrdr106). During the COVID pandamic, I even ported the application over to [MS-DOS](https://dos.top2000.app/) and VB for DOS; like why not? All source code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/rneeft/top2000) (DOS variant [here](https://github.com/rneeft/Top2000-MSDOS)).

My native language is Dutch but write/speak English at Professional level. I'm learning French and I can speak two sentes of Hindi: नमस्ते, मेरा नाम रिक है. आप से मिलकर ख़ुशी हुई and शुक्रिया.

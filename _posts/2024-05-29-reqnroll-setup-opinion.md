During my work as a software developer Iâ€™m writing a lot of tests. Some are unit tests other are end to end tests in which the whole system (including Azure infrastructure) is tested. We also creat living documentation in Specflow or [Reqnroll]( https://reqnroll.net/) as Specflow seems to be [unmaintained](https://github.com/SpecFlowOSS/SpecFlow/issues/2719#issuecomment-1998019439).
